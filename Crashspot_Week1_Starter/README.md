# Crashspot — Week 1 Starter

This folder contains:
- `Crashspot_Week1_Starter.ipynb` — step-by-step notebook to set up your environment, check installs, create folders, and make your first maps.
- `requirements.txt` — install everything with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (inside your env) or `conda install --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge`.
- `data_sources.md` — fill this out as you collect datasets.

Suggested project tree (the notebook can create it for you):
```
Crashspot/
  data_raw/
  data_clean/
  outputs/
    maps/
    figures/
  scripts/
  docs/
```

> Tip: Put your downloaded files in `data_raw/` first. The notebook shows you how to load them and save cleaned copies to `data_clean/`.
